# FavoriteBookwithSwiftUI

<li> In this project, I wanted to practice with a very simple application by introducing SwiftUI. </li>
<li> I can describe my project as an application that lists favorites in some sports. </li>
<li> First, I created the models. </li>
<li> Then I set the redirects to the Details View in the Navigation View. </li>
<li> Finally, I completed my app by adjusting the small details </li>
